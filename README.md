# SHAA Healthcare | Power BI Project

This project explores medical appointment no-shows using data from over 100,000 patient records. The goal was to analyze patterns and offer insights that could inform strategies to reduce missed appointments in a healthcare setting.

## Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard development
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

## Business Questions Answered
- What percentage of patients failed to show up?
- Are no-shows more common on certain days of the week?
- Does age, gender, or location affect likelihood of no-show?
- Do SMS reminders reduce no-show rates?
- How long are patients waiting between scheduling and the actual appointment?
- Who are the most at-risk segments, and how should we intervene?

## Key Insights
- Around 20% of patients did not attend their appointments.
- Tuesday recorded the highest number of missed appointments.
- Middle-aged patients showed a higher likelihood of missing appointments.
- Those who showed up tended to wait longer between scheduling and the appointment.
- SMS reminders had minimal effect on attendance.
- Patients without medical conditions such as alcoholism, diabetes, or hypertension were more likely to no-show.
